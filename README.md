# Financial Performance Dashboard: Multi-Market YoY Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involved the development of an interactive Excel dashboard to automate and enhance the financial analysis of performance across 20+ markets. Its primary purpose was to replace a manual, time-consuming reporting process with a dynamic, self-service tool that enables stakeholders to track and understand key profitability drivers and regional growth trends over time.

## Technical Execution
The analytical engine of this dashboard was built using Excel Power Pivot to create a robust, relational data model capable of handling consolidated multi-market data. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was employed to write calculated measures for critical metrics, including precise Year-over-Year (YoY) growth percentages for Net Sales and Gross Margin.

The front-end interface was constructed using:
- PivotTables & PivotCharts to visualize trends in Net Sales, COGS (Cost of Goods Sold), and GM% (Gross Margin Percentage).
- Interactive Slicers for dynamic filtering by region and fiscal year, allowing users to drill down from a global view to specific market performance instantly.

## Insights & Impact
This automation transformed a previously manual, hours-long reporting task into an efficient, self-service process for stakeholders, enabling real-time data exploration and decision-making.

The analysis directly identified the key drivers behind a total sales growth of 204.5% between FY20 and FY21. By clearly highlighting the highest-growth and most profitable regions, the dashboard provided actionable intelligence that helped direct strategic focus and resource allocation toward the top-performing markets.
